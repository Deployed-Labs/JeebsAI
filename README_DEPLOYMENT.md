## 🚀 How to Push and Deploy (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Make Scripts Executable (One-Time)
```bash
chmod +x make_executable.sh
./make_executable.sh
```

### Step 2: Push to Main Branch
```bash
./push_to_main.sh
```

Follow prompts to commit and push your changes.

### Step 3: Deploy to VPS

**Option A - Automatic (if SSH is configured):**
```bash
# First, edit the VPS settings:
nano push_and_deploy.sh
# Change: VPS_HOST="your-server.com"
#         VPS_USER="root"

# Then run:
./push_and_deploy.sh
```

**Option B - Manual:**
```bash
# SSH to VPS:
ssh root@your-vps.com

# On VPS:
cd /root/JeebsAI
git pull origin main
cargo build --release
sudo systemctl restart jeebs

# Or use the deploy script:
cd /root/JeebsAI
sudo ./deploy_to_vps.sh
```

## ⚡ Quick Deploy Commands

**Absolute fastest way (if configured):**
```bash
./make_executable.sh && ./push_and_deploy.sh
```

**Step by step:**
```bash
# 1. Make executable
chmod +x *.sh

# 2. Push to main
./push_to_main.sh

# 3. Deploy
ssh root@your-vps.com "cd /opt/jeebs && sudo ./deploy_to_vps.sh"
```

**Super manual (if needed):**
```bash
# Local:
git add .
git commit -m "Add learning systems"
git push origin main

# VPS:
ssh root@your-vps.com
cd /opt/jeebs
git pull
cargo build --release
sudo systemctl restart jeebs
```

## 🔍 What the VPS Deployment Does

When you run `deploy_to_vps.sh` on the VPS:

1. **Backs up database** → `/var/backups/jeebs/jeebs_TIMESTAMP.db`
2. **Stops service** → `systemctl stop jeebs`
3. **Pulls code** → `git pull origin main`
4. **Builds release** → `cargo build --release`
5. **Runs migrations** → Applies any new database changes
6. **Starts service** → `systemctl start jeebs`
7. **Checks status** → Verifies it's running
8. **Health check** → Tests HTTP response

All automatic, all safe with backups!

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

**On VPS:**
```bash
# Check service
sudo systemctl status jeebs

# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u jeebs -n 20

# Test HTTP
curl http://localhost:8080/webui/index.html
```

**Test new features:**
```bash
# From browser or API:
curl http://your-vps.com/api/knowledge/stats
curl http://your-vps.com/api/language/stats
```

**In chat:**
- Type: `knowledge stats`
- Type: `vocabulary stats`
- Type: `what do you want to do?`
- Check admin dashboard for active sessions

## 🐛 If Anything Goes Wrong

**Deployment failed?**
```bash
# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u jeebs -n 100

# Restore backup
sudo systemctl stop jeebs
sudo cp /var/backups/jeebs/jeebs_*.db /var/lib/jeebs/jeebs.db
sudo systemctl start jeebs
```

**Service won't start?**
```bash
# Rebuild manually
cd /opt/jeebs
cargo clean
cargo build --release
sudo systemctl restart jeebs
```

**Can't push to git?**
```bash
# Check remote
git remote -v

# Check branch
git branch

# Force push (careful!)
git push -f origin main
```
